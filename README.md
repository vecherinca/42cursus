# 42cursus
This is the repository that containts two first 42 projects - Libft and ft_printf. 

I'll do my best to include some useful insights that helped me while coding. 

My notes so far. 

|Project      | Note |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Libft       |112/125|
| ft_printf   | en cours..       |

## Libft
### Functions that might be tricky: 
```ft_calloc```- when it comes to calloc it is important to not forget two important conditions:
- one
- two
