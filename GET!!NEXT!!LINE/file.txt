For the most part, feminist theory has assumed that there is some
existing identity, understood through the category of women, who not
only initiates feminist interests and goals within discourse,
but constitutes the subject for whom political representation is pursued.
But politics and representation are controversial terms. On the one hand,
representation serves as the operative term within a political process
that seeks to extend visibility and legitimacy to women as political subjects;
on the other hand, representation is the normative function
of a language which is said either to reveal or to distort what is
assumed to be true about the category of women. For feminist theory,
the development of a language that fully or adequately represents
women has seemed necessary to foster the political visibility of women.
